# NON-NPC
A "No NPC" FiveM script is a modification for the FiveM multiplayer game that removes non-player characters (NPCs) from the game world. This script is designed for players who prefer a more realistic and immersive experience in the game, as it removes the often repetitive and artificial behaviors of NPCs.
With this script, players can enjoy a more authentic and unpredictable environment as they navigate the game world without the presence of NPCs. This can make the game more challenging, as players will have to rely solely on other players and their own skills to complete objectives and survive in the game world.

The "No NPC" FiveM script is easy to install and can be customized to suit the preferences of individual players. It is compatible with a wide range of servers and game modes, making it a versatile addition to any FiveM setup.

Whether you're a seasoned FiveM player looking for a new challenge or a newcomer to the game looking for a more immersive experience, the "No NPC" FiveM script is a great choice for anyone looking to enhance their gameplay.
